# AWS CDK Serverless API (TypeScript)

## Purpose
This project demonstrates deploying a serverless REST API on AWS using CDK (TypeScript) to understand how declarative infrastructure translates into CloudFormation-managed resources, IAM permissions, and live AWS services.

## Architecture Overview
This project deploys a serverless REST API on AWS using AWS CDK. The architecture consists of an Amazon API Gateway REST API that exposes a `/hello` endpoint, an AWS Lambda function (Node.js 18) that handles incoming requests, and an IAM execution role that allows the function to write logs to Amazon CloudWatch. All resources are provisioned and managed through an AWS CloudFormation stack generated by CDK.

## Implementation Details
- Implemented the infrastructure using AWS CDK in TypeScript to model resources as code and synthesize them into a CloudFormation-managed stack.
- Packaged the Lambda function as a local asset and integrated it with API Gateway using a REST API and Lambda integration.
- Allowed CDK to manage IAM role creation and approval-gated security changes to ensure controlled permissions during deployment.

The primary CDK stack definition is located in the `lib/` directory and defines the API Gateway, Lambda function, and associated IAM resources.

## Deployment & Validation
The stack was deployed using the AWS CDK CLI, which synthesized the infrastructure into a CloudFormation stack and provisioned all resources successfully. After deployment, the API Gateway endpoint was accessed via a web browser by appending `/hello` to the generated base URL. The request invoked the Lambda function and returned a JSON response, confirming end-to-end functionality. Execution was further verified by reviewing Lambda logs in Amazon CloudWatch.

## Notes / Scope Decisions
This project intentionally maintains a small scope to focus on understanding AWS CDK fundamentals and how declarative infrastructure maps to CloudFormation-managed resources. Additional services such as authentication, persistence layers, or CI/CD pipelines were deliberately excluded to keep the implementation focused, reproducible, and easy to reason about. The project serves as a foundation that could be extended in future iterations if needed.
